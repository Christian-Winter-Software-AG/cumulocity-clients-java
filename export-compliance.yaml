7.3) Is the Surveyed Item encryption software, or a commodity, or a component thereof, that is designed, modified or customized for a government end user or end use?: false
7.3.1) Does the Surveyed Item - independent of any supported cryptographic content or abilities - make use of any software, hardware or Technology , that has the property of being specifically developed for military purposes (that you/R&D are aware of)?: false
7.4) Does the Surveyed Item provide proprietary cryptographic functionality or is it an encryption component that is user-accessible and that can be easily changed by the user?: false
  # Encryption component does not include encryption software that would be considered 'publicly available' (e.g. products with license exception TSU), as that term is used in section 740.13(e)(1) of the EAR.
7.5) Does the Surveyed Item provide functionality necessary to perform quantum cryptography?: false
7.6) Is the Surveyed Item encryption software that was modified or customized for high-performance digital computers?: false
7.7) Does the Surveyed Item perform crypto-analytic functions?: false
  # Systems, equipment, applications, specific electronic assemblies, modules and integrated circuits designed or modified to perform cryptanalytic functions,
  # software having the characteristics of cryptanalytic hardware or performing cryptanalytic functions, or technology for the
  # development, production or use of cryptanalytic commodities or software.
7.8) Does the Surveyed Item incorporate an open cryptographic interface (OCI)?: false
  # Note: Java 1.6 - 1.8 are not considered to contain an OCI
  # In general, this is a mechanism designed to allow a customer or other party to insert cryptographic functionality without the intervention, help or assistance
  # of the manufacturer (here Software AG) or its agents, e.g.manufacturer's signing of cryptographic code or proprietary interfaces
  # (i.e. delivery of Java without JCE module would constitute such an open cryptographic interface).
  # If the cryptographic interface implements a fixed set of cryptographic algorithms, key lengths or key exchange management systems, that cannot be changed,
  # it will not be considered an "open" cryptographic interface. All general application programming interfaces
  # (e.g., those that accept either a cryptographic or non-cryptographic interface but do not themselves maintain any cryptographic functionality)
  # will not be considered "open" cryptographic interfaces.
# 7.9) This section involves transfer of Technology relating to the Surveyed Item:
7.9.1) Is non-standard proprietary cryptography Technology transferred to end users of the Surveyed Item?: false
7.9.2) Is Technology other than crypto-analytic, non-standard-crypto, or OCI items transferred to end users of the Surveyed Item?: false
7.10) Is the Surveyed Item encryption software, or an encryption commodity, or a component, THAT is designed, modified or customized for a government end user or end use?: false
  # NB: This is numbered "7.10" in the AgileApps tool but "7.10.1" in the PDF AgileApps generates - here we use the PDF numbering
7.10.1) Is the Surveyed Item encryption software, or an encryption commodity, or a component, THAT CONTAINS or can use or activate one or more of the following resources?: false
  # NB: This is number "7.10.2" in the AgileApps tool
  # True if the product is an SDK that enables development applications that adhere to Java Specification Requests (JSRs) or other specifications
  # that support the use of cryptography. Otherwise, click No. Also false if the surveyed item incorporates and uses an already classified Software AG's
  # Software Designer Framework Component (SDF) for provision of such functionality.
7.10.1.1) The SDK uses cryptographic functions of a connected library only for accessing other resources securely, but the Main-Product does not expose such a crypto library's functions to other software or to the modules themselves that are written with: false
7.10.1.2) The SDK provides cryptographic functions of built-in crypto facilities - or access to crypto functions from connected, external libraries - to other software or to the modules themselves that are written with that SDK (SDK WITH CRYPTO): false
7.10.1.3) The SDK not just provides access to crypto functions but (also) explicitly provides means to build new cryptographic functions (CRYPTO SDK): false

 # if false, skip 7.10.2.* questions
  # Note: Such a Crypto SDK must be treated like an 'SDK with crypto', requiring official BIS reviews whenever a modification of cryptography is applied to any crypto function of underlying crypto libraries. Such activities require advanced/early TCA review!
  # BIS acknowledged that the language of this question [= 740.17 (b)(3)(iv)] is a bit unclear and that it might possibly be clarified in the future.
  # Basically, this question intends to capture products that 'turn on,' such as via a license key, hardware dongle, or some other software routine,
  # cryptographic functionality in another product that would otherwise remain dormant or inaccessible to the user. Such products still require the
  # official 30-day classification request even if the crypto functionality that is being activated or turned on would be self-classifiable.
  # However, an important distinction must be made between products that "activate or enable cryptographic functionality...which would otherwise remain disabled"
  # and products that simply call to or use cryptographic functionality that is already available to the user. For instance, APX 8.2, which BIS
  # determined would be eligible for self-classification under G400014, "uses the built-in encryption functionality of Microsoft .NET security APIs from the .NET runtime."
  # This use or call of crypto functionality that the user already has access to (that is, is already enabled) would imply an answer of No answer to this question.

# APPENDIX
# Provide an explanation of the purpose of any applied encryption, describe the data that is being encrypted,
# and provide a list of algorithms used in the encryption (including symmetry type and associated key lengths).
# Also provide any additional comments.
8.1) Describe additional important technical details here: 

8.2.1) Third parties that implement cryptography:
  # The TPs/components directly containing (NOT just indirectly using/accessing) cryptographic
  # functionality must be listed here since version upgrades to these libraries must be checked
  # for changes that could affect the export classification

  # For each one, if crypto is used by Surveyed Item &/or provided for external use, specify the
  # "purpose" (what this item uses cryptography for e.g. TLS payload confidentiality)
  # and if known, what strength of cryptography (algos/key lengths).
  # The section 6.1 questions may need updating if the strength increases

  # When crypto is NOT used or provided for external use, specify "not used"
  8.2.1a) Components:
  8.2.1b) Third parties:
    httpclient:
      Algorithm: SSL/TLS
      Purpose: Https connection to third party systems
    Java-WebSocket:
      Algorithm: SSL/TLS
      Purpose: Secure web socket connection to notificatio 2.0

8.2.2) Third parties that use (or provide for external use) cryptography implemented by another library:
  # This is only for libraries that do NOT implement cryptography themselves
  # It is only required to list libraries that determine the usage/purpose i.e. what this item uses cryptography for (e.g. TLS payload confidentiality)
  # or the strength (algorithm/key length) of the cryptography
  # (which may be a subset of what cryptographic implementations like JDK/OpenSSL are capable of)

  # For each one, if crypto is used by Surveyed Item &/or provided for external use, specify
  # the purpose (e.g. TLS payload confidentiality) and if known what strength of cryptography (algos/key lengths).
