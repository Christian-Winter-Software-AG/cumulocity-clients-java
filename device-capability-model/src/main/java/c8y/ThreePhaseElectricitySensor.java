/**
 * Provides a representation for a single phase electricity sensor.
 * 
 * An electricity sensor typically measures energy consumption (usually measured in kWh), but more complex sensors can also measure
 * instantaneous power (usually measured in W), reactive power, harmonic distortion, etc.
 * 
 * A three phase meter can perform these measurements for three phases at the same time (typical industrial usage).
 * 
 * At this moment in time, this representation does not have any properties of its own.
