 * Provides a representation for a single phase electricity sensor.

 * instantaneous power (W), reactive power, harmonic distortion, etc.
 * 
 * A single phase meter can perform these measurements for a single phase (typical home usage).
 * 
 * At this moment in time, this representation does not have any properties of its own.
